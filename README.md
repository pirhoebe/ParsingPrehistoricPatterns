# ParsingPrehistoricPatterns
Supplementary Information to Hoebe, Peeters &amp; Arnoldussen 2023. Parsing Prehistoric Patterns. Journal of Archaeological Science Reports

The scripts and data in this supplementary material are the basis of the analysis conducted in the abovementioned paper.
This SI consists of 6 main scripts that:

1 prepare the dataset

2 demonstrate the general temporal distribution in the dataset with aoristics

3 explore the impact of vetting on the spatiotemporal distribution

4 show the general frequency distribution through SPD and KDE

5 conduct the main analysis: modeltesting and permutation testing the SPDs

6 support calculations done in the text


There are several supporting scripts that are called upon in the main script.These facilitate running certain functions and serve to declutter the scripts.
The execution of these supporting scripts requires input parameters that are displayed with a message. These parameters have to be set manually if one wants to use the supporting scripts seperately.
